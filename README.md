# About
**ChiFi Degens** is an upcoming generative PFP NFT project on Chia, created by SynthwaveAndy.

Let's face it, we're all a bunch of ChiFi Degens at heart,

Some of us are `Church of Chia` Degens, who worship at the house of Gene.<br/>
Some are `Tactical` degens, waiting for the perfect opportunity to win an event or scoop a rare.<br/>
Maybe you're a `Stealth Degen`, and don't like showing off your Degen ways in public.<br/>
Or just maybe, you're a `Brazen Degen` with your gold chains, yacht and golden grills!<br/>


No matter what kind of Degen you are, there is a ChiFi Degen for you!

### NFTokenomics:
 - Collection of **2000**.
 - Minting and Dropping in Batches of 400 every 3 Days from launch date [TBA]
 - Over 90 Unique Traits over 9 layers (Could end up at 100 tbh)

### CAT Tokens, CATokenomics, Pricing
 - **CAT Token Airdrop** to all **Proof of Synth and Time supporters (1 per NFT owned)** and collaborators (2 ea.). [Name of CAT TBA]
 - CAT Airdrop will be a few days before Launch [Key Dates TBA]
 - **Supply: Approx 250-300.** Supply will be confirmed on airdrop day.
 - ~12hrs **Early Access** to all Batch Drops for CAT Holders!
 - During that time, Degens will only be purchasable with **1 CAT + 0.02 XCH** (~$1 USD)
 - After the 12 Hours, the Batches will be open for non-CAT holders for **0.25 XCH standard price**
 - There will be no "price drops" like there has been with Proof of Synth and Time.
 - I will create a Buy offer for the CAT Tokens on Dexie, this offer will be unobtanium (i.e., 50 CAT for 1 xch)
 - The buy offer will simply allow people to find the token on the Dexie List, in case anyone wants to sell / trade their CAT's

### Collaborations
The Degens will feature traits from a range of collaborators, as well as community themes and memes!

I'm still reaching out to collaborators, 
The following collaborators are keen to have traits reference their project:
- ChiaSlimes
- MonkeyZoo ($MZ)
- xchbob ($BigD)
- Acevail (Mystical Marmots, maybe MintGarden)
- QuirkyGiraffes
- HexPals
- Duck Friends
- Daryl (Who literally inspired this entire project!)
- ...
- More to come!

### When!?
I will release a **Roadmap** in due time with set key dates, Degens is still in it's early stages.
At this point i have ~33% of the art done, have reached out to 50% of collab's and will still have to write a bit of code for the CAT Airdrop and offer building.

### Final Word
Currently, if i wanted to, i could generate `648,121,824` **Unique** NFT's with the planned traits.
**Proof of Synth and Time** has a lot of traits, which are essentially the same but with a different Hue (color)
**ChiFi Degens** traits will almost all be completely unique, with the exception of some of the Eyes, which will share Shape, with differing colors.

All of this should indicate how diverse the collection will be, when scrolling a list and how much Time and Effort i'm putting into this.
For example the Yacht above took 8 hours to draw, and that's just 1 trait!

I really feel that the Chia NFT space is missing a collection which really connects with the community. 
Chia Friend's is arguably the closest in terms of historical signifigance, but i feel it doesn't hit the mark on community culture representation. We all know what we are! A Bunch of ChiFi Degens!
