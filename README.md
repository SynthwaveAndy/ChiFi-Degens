### About
**ChiFi Degen's** is a generative PFP NFT project on Chia, created by [SynthwaveAndy](https://twitter.com/ProofOfSynthNFT).

Let's face it, we're all a bunch of ChiFi Degen's at heart,

Some of us are `Devoted` Degens, who worship at the house of Gene.<br/>
Maybe you're a `Stealth` Degen, and don't like showing off your Degen ways in public.<br/>
Perhaps a `Well Endowed` Degen with your $BigD Necklace <br/>
Or just maybe, you're a `Brazen` Degen with your gold chains, yacht and golden grills!<br/>

No matter what kind of Degen you are, there's a ChiFi Degen for you!

### Final Word
If i wanted to, i could have generated `2.7 Billion` **Unique** NFT's with the traits for **ChiFi Degen's**.

**ChiFi Degen's** traits will almost all be completely unique, with the exception of some of the Eyes and Hair Colors, which will share Shape, with differing colors.

All of this should indicate how diverse the collection appears when scrolling a list and how much Time and Effort it took me to accomplish this Solo.

I really felt that the Chia NFT space was missing a collection which really connects with the community. I feel they don't hit the mark on community culture representation. We all know what we are! A Bunch of ChiFi Degen's!
